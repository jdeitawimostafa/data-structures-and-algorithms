## code challenge 33 : 

* Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

* Write a function called left join :
1. Arguments: two hash maps
2. The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
3. The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
4. Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic .
